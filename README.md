# Get_Ecole_42_projects
A script to get the latest commit version of my projects from Ecole 42

Clone the repo. 
Execute the script as `./script.sh` (Be sure to have the exec authorization)

This script has been made to have an access to all the Ecole-42 projects, in their latest versions -> quicker and lighter than getting the all repo of each project
